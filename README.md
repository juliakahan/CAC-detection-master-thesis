# Coronary Artery Calcification Detection on Non-Gated Chest CT

This repository contains the code and scripts developed as part of the MSc thesis:

Detection and quantitative assessment of coronary artery calcifications on chest computed tomography
Author: Julia Kahan, AGH University of Science and Technology, KrakÃ³w, 2025

ðŸ“Œ Overview

Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a well-established biomarker of atherosclerosis and an independent predictor of major cardiovascular events.
This project implements a deep learningâ€“based pipeline for the segmentation of coronary arteries and mediastinum using nnU-Net, followed by automated CAC detection and Agatston scoring on non-gated chest CT scans.

The pipeline is composed of four main stages:

* Dataset preparation â€“ exporting labelmaps, converting to NIfTI, and assembling the nnU-Net raw dataset.

* Segmentation â€“ training and inference using nnU-Net (v2).

* CAC detection and scoring â€“ applying intensity thresholding and Agatston methodology within segmented vessels.

* Evaluation â€“ numeric correlations, categorical agreement, and distribution summaries.
